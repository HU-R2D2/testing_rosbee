/// @brief Class for receiving and reading the Sony SIRC protocol.
///
/// The Sirc class provides a simple interface for interpreting the Sony SIRC protocol 
/// using the TSOP348 IR receiver.
/// Please note that this class expected the following from the IR reciver: 
/// active low: 1 = no signal, 0 = signal is received. 
/// I'm aware that simpeltools.h provides a similar functionalty. But for some reason it didn't work
/// correctly with either my remote or the TSOP348 IR receiver.

  /// Function to count the width of a pluse.
  /// @return Pulse width multiplied  by 100 us. Aka a return value of 24 is 2400 us in real time.
